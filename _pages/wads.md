## WADS ##
  * Collected in the snow belt region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula
  * First multi-modal dataset featuring dense point-wise labeled sequential LiDAR scans collected in severe winter weather
  * Over 26 TB of multi modal data has been collected
  * Over 7 GB of LiDAR point clouds (3.6 billion points) have been labeled

## Download ##
  * Labeled sequences can be downloaded here wads.
  * The dataset follows the semanticKITTI format. Please refer to the directory structure described there.
